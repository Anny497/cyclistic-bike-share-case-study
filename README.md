# cyclistic-bike-share-case-study
This is the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course capstone project. In this case study, I will analyze a public dataset for a fictional bike-share company provided by Google. This is a large dataset with millions of rows, so I will be using both SQL an R programming language to analyze the dataset.
